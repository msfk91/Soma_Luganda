# Soma_Luganda
Soma Luganda is supposed to be an educational website that teaches people how to speak Luganda. 
Luganda is an African language from the country Uganda.
So far I am the only person who is working on this website and I have gotten stuck.
I am having massive trouble incorporating Stripe into my website because as you might have guessed the service that Soma Luganda provides
will not be free.
SOMA LUGANDA IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ONLINE SUBSCRIPTION BASED EDUCATIONAL WEB SERVICE. WHERE MEMBERS PAY ONCE A MONTH.
Anyways I need help with Stripe webhooks and emailing new stripe customers. I also need help emailing members who have missed a payment.
I also need to kick members out of the members section who have missed a payment, and let them back in once they have made another payment.
In other words this project is far from done and I could use all the help I can get to get this project off the ground.
Thank you for your interest and thank you for your contributions.
